- Spectrum licence info is public data, and the best place to get data is on
ACMA’s websites, especially
https://web.acma.gov.au/rrl/register_search.main_page where you can search for
actual licence documentation. There is a map page on the left (Spectrum Areas
Map), but it’s a little clunky. I usually use the Frequency Ranges Search if I
want to find more info. Let me know if there’s further or specific info you may
need and I can guide you.
- In the attached, FDD refers to frequency division duplex, which means data
being downloaded is on one frequency, while data being uploaded is on another
frequency. FDD spectrum bands are always paired, hence the 2 x # MHz notation.
For example, 2x5 MHz means there’s 5 MHz for download and 5 MHz for upload.
I’ve used the paired MHz definition, i.e. if a cell in the FDD tab says 5 MHz,
it really means 2x5 MHz.
- TDD is time division duplex, which means download and upload are separated in
time to avoid interference (e.g. 1 second the whole network is downloading, the
next second it is uploading, etc.). Frequencies above 3 GHz tend to be TDD.
There’s no paired concept here – 10 MHz is just 10 MHz, used for both download
and upload at different times.
- You’ll notice that there is a lot variation when it comes to spectrum areas,
i.e. some frequencies are nationwide, some are in very specific towns. For now,
maybe just have the largest 6 or so cities separately, and create an “other”
option rather than getting the exact geographies. The exact polygon boundaries
exist in the actual licence documentation, but let’s not worry about those right
now.
