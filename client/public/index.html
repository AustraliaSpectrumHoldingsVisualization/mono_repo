        About
      </h2>
      <h3>
        The Australian Radio Spectrum is consumed via licences from the
        Government to private companies based on Spectrum/Frequency, Modulation,
        Geographical Area, and duration of the licence.<br/><br/>
        This information is public data, but currently there is no visualization
        tool which displays who currently owns the licence for what part of the
        spectrum.<br/><br/>
        This is frustrating as a consumer, since consumers cannot easily
        find or use this spectrum information to help decide which
        Telecommunications Provider will be the best fit for their
        circumstances.<br/><br/>
        Additionally, this is frustrating as a Telecommunications Provider,
        because currently static, hard to distribute/share, internal tools such
        as spreadsheet files must be used as the source of truth for Spectrum
        Holding Visualization data, whimch is a bottleneck for data input when
        making decisions on upcoming auctions of licences.<br/><br/>
        There should be an easy way for consumers, and Telecommunications
        Providers to view this information. Everyone uses Telecommunications,
        this is such vital information.<br/><br/>
