# Project Goals

The Australian Radio Spectrum is consumed via licences from the Government to
private companies based on Spectrum/Frequency, Modulation, Geographical Area,
and duration of the licence.

This information is public data, but currently there is no visualization tool
which displays who currently owns the licence for what part of the spectrum.

This is frustrating as a Telecommunications Provider, because currently static,
hard to distribute/share, internal tools such as spreadsheet files must be used
as the source of truth for Spectrum Holding Visualization data, which is a 
bottleneck for data input when making decisions on upcoming auctions of
licences.

Additionally, this is frustrating as a consumer, since consumers cannot easily
find or use this spectrum information to help decide which Telecommunications
Provider will be the best fit for their circumstances.

There should be an easy way for a Telecommunications Provider, and consumers,
to view this information. Everyone uses Telecommunications, this is such vital
information.
